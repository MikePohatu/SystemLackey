# SystemLackey

SystemLackey is a system automation tool. It's primary focus is to provide scripting engine functionality, similar to that provided by tools such as Altiris and SCCM. 

The main goals for SystemLackey are as follows:<br>
1. To serve as a project for me to learn C# and programming in general.<br>
2. To provide a light weight scriting engine type tool that doesn't require server infrastructure.<br>
3. To have that same tool be able to integrate with a server infrastructure when one is built.<br>
4. To implement or fix all the things that I think are missing or wrong with the popular system management tools available.<br>
<br>
Feedback and feature requests are encouraged, but please note goal #1. <br>
